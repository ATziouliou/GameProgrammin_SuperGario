# GameProgrammin_SuperGario

Super Gario Jump is very similar to super Mario.
It uses some collision physics for picking up the coins and for not falling off the map.
It uses sprites to create the level design, and its quite customisable.
It uses simple GUI for the different blocks and coins.
It's running on a platform engine in VisualStudio.
